# VCR Cassettes

This directory contains HTTP recordings for testing the Something Awful forum parser.

## Cassettes

### synthetic_single_page.yml

A completely fabricated forum page with 40 synthetic posts. This cassette was generated by `bin/generate_synthetic_cassette` and contains:

- **Thread ID**: 1000001
- **Posts**: 40 posts from 5 different test users
- **Users**: TestUser1-TestUser5 with fake registration dates and post content
- **Content**: Lorem ipsum style text with no real user data

This cassette is used to test the HTML parsing functionality without hitting the live forum or exposing real user data.

## Generating New Cassettes

To regenerate the synthetic cassette:

```bash
ruby bin/generate_synthetic_cassette
```

This will create a fresh cassette with the expected HTML structure for 40 posts on a single page.

## Important Notes

- **Never commit cassettes with real forum data** - they may contain usernames, post content, and other personal information
- All cassettes in this directory should contain only synthetic/fabricated data
- VCR is configured to filter sensitive environment variables (SA_USERNAME, SA_PASSWORD)
- For live testing, cassettes are generated temporarily and should be deleted after validation
